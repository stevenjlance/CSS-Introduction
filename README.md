# CSS INTRODUCTION
Today we will be styling our pages using CSS. We create rulesets in our style.css file in order to style our content that we created with HTML. For example, if we wished to style all `h1` elements to be the color red we would write the ruleset:
```css
h1 {
	color: red;
}
```

## Today's Task
[Using the documentation on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp), try each of the following for text on the page:

1. Color
2. Background Color
3. Text (font-family, font-size, font-weight)
4. Padding
5. Margins

As a bonus, you may also want to try a sixth style:

6. Shadows
